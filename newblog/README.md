# 🔷 Databricks Multi-Task Job: Task Dependencies Demo

This project demonstrates how to configure a Databricks Job with **three interdependent tasks**, each pointing to a separate Databricks notebook. The goal is to showcase task orchestration within a Databricks job using notebook workflows.

## 📊 Overview

The job consists of the following tasks:

- **Task A:** Executes first; has no dependencies.
- **Task B:** Depends on Task A.
- **Task C:** Depends on Task A.

This creates a **fan-out structure**, where Task A runs first and Tasks B and C execute in parallel once Task A is complete.

Task A
├── Task B
└── Task C

## 📘 Notebooks

| Task   | Notebook Path                  | Description                      |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Task A | `/Workspace/Jobs/TaskA`        | Preprocessing / Initialization   |
| Task B | `/Workspace/Jobs/TaskB`        | Main Logic Branch 1              |
| Task C | `/Workspace/Jobs/TaskC`        | Main Logic Branch 2              |

You can customize each notebook to perform operations such as reading from Delta tables, transforming data, and writing outputs to storage.

## ⚙️ Setting Up the Job

1. Navigate to **Jobs** in the Databricks workspace.
2. Click **Create Job**.
3. Add **Task A**:
   - Task name: `Task A`
   - Type: Notebook
   - Notebook path: `/Workspace/Jobs/TaskA`
4. Add **Task B**:
   - Task name: `Task B`
   - Depends on: `Task A`
   - Notebook path: `/Workspace/Jobs/TaskB`
5. Add **Task C**:
   - Task name: `Task C`
   - Depends on: `Task A`
   - Notebook path: `/Workspace/Jobs/TaskC`

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Parallel execution with dependency management
- ✅ Easy to extend to DAG-based workflows
- ✅ Suitable for ETL, ML pipelines, and modular data processing

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Imagine Task A is a data ingestion step, and Tasks B and C perform:
- Model training
- Data quality checks
- Report generation

This approach ensures you never run downstream logic until your upstream logic completes successfully.
